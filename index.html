            <h3>Testimonial of Cookie Eating Family</h3>
            <p>Pat's Salmon Cookies literally saved our
              daugher's life. Prior to finding this delectible
              treat, our daughter was bullied, teased, and did poorly
              in all school subjects. Her favorite snack was paste,
              because she said it smelled like mint. 

              Now, after only a week of eating only Pat's Salmon Cookies 
              for every meal of the day, our daughter has blossomed. She 
              became the most popular kid in school, skipped three grades of
              math, and this has transformed our family. Just look at us. 
              We are so happy. She plays soccer so well that the Seattle Reign 
              offered her a contract, andt she is only 11 years old!
